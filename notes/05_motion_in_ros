List of functions
void move(double speed, double distance, bool isForward);          a method move will be developed that allows the robot to move straight (speed, distance, forward or backward)
void rotate (double angular_speed, double andle, bool clockwise); a function that rottates robot
double degree2radians(double angle_in_degrees);                     all angles in ros are express in radian this converts degrees to radians
void poseCallback(const turtlesim::Pose::ConstPtr & pose_message);
double setAbsoluteOrientation (double desired_angle);
//double clean()
double getDistance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2):
//void moveGoal(turtlesim::Pose goal_pose, double)

for this tutorial were going to make another package, later see if you can make this package its own node or maybe just have yourself refer to a repo in github

remember to create package cd to project workspace src folder
then type catkin_create_package package_name depend1 in this case turtlesim_cleaner is one of the dependables
go back to project worksapce and type catkin build
add src file if it doesnt have one so type mkdir src
